figure out how to display errors from axios - maybe dnt use fuckin react-query, do it normal way instead with axios and useState

1. Do proper error handling on the server - different errors come from zod validation and different from route handeler, unify it all so it can be easily interpreted on the client. If its a zod error have to find a way to capture that zod error object on the server and make it into nice serialized Error

1. Handle validation errors on the client

1. Add logout route

1. Change client to make it look like youtube with tailwind

1. Add tests to server for route handelers

1. Maybe add test to client
